	FIXME should it be selfOpen instead of leftOpen and rightOpen?
	
	FIXME should Split know about height and width sizes recursively? Or leave that to Branch?
	
	TODO should Split have isOneLine var?
	
	TODO use vm.ParseTree to get syty (syntax type) of this.fn.
	
	TODO when start dragging with mouse, it should grab a Split, not a Branch?

//draggable tree node, view of a fn/lambda as a var size list or literal. Literals can be text, sounds, canvas bytes, etc.
var Branch = function(split){

	FIXME, should Branch be immutable (other than maybe some dob/domObject optimizations)?
	Yes, do that. But optimize for reusing canvas(es) for low lag cuz changing dom tree maybe is not as fast as video frames in canvas.
	Might cause a problem with renaming #Names after theyre displayed.
	Maybe Names and literals(like a pic displayed in canvas, changing every 1/60 second for interactive video) should
	be in a separate js type than Branch, so they can update on their own, without changing size, and without interfering
	with the Branch objects?
	Should each Branch take a height and width in its constructor, maybe in units of monospaced chars?
		That could be a problem for magnifying/shrinking big names to fit in the same space.
	Imagine dragging a Branch (a rectangle on screen) onto another Branch to call it, in {} [] () or <>.
		Just making the tree causes the call.
	Fixing some of that using the Split class which is an immutable view of 
		
	
	
	//this.fn = fn;
	this.split = split;
	
	//or if its displayed as just a Name# (defined somewhere else) then no prefix or suffix.

	this.suffix = ''; //Examples: ] } ) >
