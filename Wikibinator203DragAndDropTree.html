		And is there lazyEval of creating left and right Split childs when observed,
			cuz without that how would you look deeper into a very big forest of fns viewed by Splits?
	...
	I basically want forkEditable maps of fn to displayParams, except the fns can be duplicated,
	so maybe key is fn_with_arbitraryNumber?
	No, the map should use a fn and l l l r l r r l paths in it as key.
	I can make forkEditable treemaps, but the problem seems to be I want to be able to expand it on both ends,
	the parent direction and the childs direction.
	Need to copy these trees of Split and keep which parts are open/closed in the copy,
	make variants, mix them in various combos, etc.
	
	Here's the design (closer to it, todo keep fixing this...):
	A leaf Split is a closed view of a fn. A split can be made of any 2 Splits or be a leaf.
	Opening such a closed Split requires forkEdit all the way up the immutable tree of Split,
	which requires updating display of everything changed during that,
	but FIXME... FIXME... A dob cant have 2 parents, so either need to use immutable graphics,
	such as tree of y10x10rgb12 voxels with offset per branch, or make new dobs in the whole tree with each change.
	
	Pics as canvas bytes need to be cached somehow.
	Maybe fn.n.blob is a good enough cache, being the canvas bytes directly in some cases.
	I dont want to replace text on screen after every open/close, cuz it might interfere with which text is selected,
	but on the other hand you wont be actively using the text selection when you're opening/closing something.
	
	SOLUTION: Fixing this by dividing Split into 2 classes: Split (immutable, up from any closed leafs),
	and Splat (mutable, has dom nodes). Split.prototype.displayIn(Splat) fills in those dom nodes,
	and replaces some dom nodes if they're no longer used.
	Split can share branches and is a forest (like fn). Split might be made of fns later (TODO?).
	Splat is a tree and cant share branches.
	A split is dragged from any part of Splat to any part of Splat.

//draggable tree node, view of a fn/lambda as a var size list or literal. Literals can be text, sounds, canvas bytes, etc.
var Branch = function(split){

	FIXME, should Branch be immutable (other than maybe some dob/domObject optimizations)?
	Yes, do that. But optimize for reusing canvas(es) for low lag cuz changing dom tree maybe is not as fast as video frames in canvas.
	Might cause a problem with renaming #Names after theyre displayed.
	Maybe Names and literals(like a pic displayed in canvas, changing every 1/60 second for interactive video) should
	be in a separate js type than Branch, so they can update on their own, without changing size, and without interfering
	with the Branch objects?
	Should each Branch take a height and width in its constructor, maybe in units of monospaced chars?
		That could be a problem for magnifying/shrinking big names to fit in the same space.
	Imagine dragging a Branch (a rectangle on screen) onto another Branch to call it, in {} [] () or <>.
