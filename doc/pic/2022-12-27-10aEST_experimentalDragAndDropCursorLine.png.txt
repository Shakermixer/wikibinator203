Try #wikibinator at http://memecombinator.io/testDragAndDrop/ . The drag and drop and right click menu works, mostly, but its still confusing, so next I'm going to make a way of drag and drop that doesnt need the popup menu. I learned enuf to do that from playing with this. Then loops/if/else/etc

"a way of drag and drop that doesnt need the popup menu". Every time you drag and drop a lambda, you find or create a lambda. When I get this new kind of drag and drop working, it should allow me to manually create 10000 lambdas per day, not to mention the generated lambdas.

Each lambda is 32 bytes and has 2 child lambdas. If 100k people did that together, would be a billion lambdas manually created per day, that could be securely called on eachother in all possible combos.
