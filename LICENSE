Nobody owns wikibs. They are shared facts of maths many people and software
can use together. A wikib is a kind of number, stateless and immutable
(or approximations of it in some ways of using it)
universal lambda function, pattern-calculus function, a fact of math, a
pure function, and a data structure that is defined completely as a forest
node with 2 child wikibs down to leaf (leaf also has 2 childs (identity
function and leaf)). Leaf (aka U aka Wikibinator203) is the universal
function, from which all turing-complete patterns of finite amount of
information can be built, used, and shared. Forall wikib x, forall wikib y,
x called on y is a wikib, which may be halted or evaling (to a halted wikib
or never halts). Every wikib is a derivative-work of leaf, which can be
proven by calling leaf on itself in various combinations, to make any wikib.
While obeying this license and using a wikibinator203 VM that correctly
implements the spec, it is safe to call any wikib on any wikib since all
it does is find or create wikibs, but if its used to control external
systems (such as robots, buying and selling things, or telling people
what to believe or what to do outside a simulated world, or copying a
wikib to a new file, renaming that file x.exe, then double-clicking that
file), it is entirely the responsibility of who hooks it to those systems
to verify its safe, such as by math proofs, networks of digital signatures,
or other evidence, especially considering that it can create all possible
computer viruses and ransomware and other evil things (safely in a
sandbox across 1 or many computers) and good things, and that in 1 of
its 2 namespaces (evilbit=true), it is an antivirus quarantine and
uncensored area, a sandbox across whichever computers opt into using
this data structure together, where all possible wikibs are allowed.
In the antivirus quarantine, you may share viruses like posts in a
social network, turing-complete messages that others may, for example,
say ["this is a virus" TheVirus] or use the virus in a meme-like piece
of art (such as a satirical work making fun of viruses could literally
contain such viruses) and do experiments, make games, musical
instruments, tools, or anything of pure information. It would be very
destructive to the system if there is any possible math statement which
is not allowed, such as removing a virus or other "evil" wikibs while
it has incoming pointers. It would be destructive to the wikib systems,
because halting-oracles have been proven impossible, and a halting-oracle
would be needed to determine if a certain wikib would generate, or would
not generate, a certain other wikib, without waiting up to an infinite
time to observe what it does (by the universal lambda math). The other
namespace (evilbit=false) works like the normal internet, if those who
opt in can find a way to do that without breaking the wikib math so much
its unusable, a way to claim a certain wikib is safe, unlike in
evilbit=true where there is no reasonable expectation that it is safe
to give those wikibs execute permission, or to believe any information
in them, or to obey anything they might tell you to do with a message
on the screen. It would be negligence for someone to give execute
permission to, believe, or obey, anything in an antivirus quarantine
(which many apps may run inside across many computers) if that causes
a problem, and similarly for the evilbit=false area, since saying its
evilbit=true or evilbit=false (which happens in the first byte of a
256 bit id for example) is just a word that people or computers can
say about a wikib, that they believe it to be safe or not.
If in doubt, use evilbit=true aka antivirus quarantine.

If there is any conflict between the above "Nobody owns wikibs" paragraph and the below 2 paragraphs copied from MIT license,
then that "Nobody owns wikibs" paragraph wins, overpowers the legal effects, of the 2 paragraphs below,
and if that is not legally possible to do then it is not legally possible to use this software at all.
