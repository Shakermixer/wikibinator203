If you want the universal lambda that works, go to <a href=https://github.com/benrayfield/wikibinator106>wikibinator106</a>, for now. This different universal lambda function will hopefully be working soon with some simple games and demos people can play together, as actual javascript lambdas that implement the universal lambda math.

First app running on this will maybe be musical instruments similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data that can be shared in realtime to build more musical instruments with and so on, and this "proof of concept" will be able to scale to millions of simultaneous instruments being played and generated and evolved, and every bit, every tiny part of a sound vibration, is a lambda.

Custom opensource copyleft license to be written, basically similar to the MIT license except that you cant own the generated lambdas and that the evil_bit being on or off in each 256 bit id means 1 of 2 namespaces, one where things work as normal and the other where "anything goes" as its an "antivirus quarantine" and uncensored area, but be warned that in the "normal" area people might tend to remove lambdas while incoming pointers exist which could break things in the normal area while the evil_bit=true area will not remove anything while incoming pointers exist (and even then might still not), because of merkle garbage collection as a technical reason, and because of free speech. There is no central control of this, as its just a data format and way people might share lambdas with eachother in realtime, so I'm just another user, like you, of lambdas. Even though where "anything goes" there will be viruses and worse, if someone sneaks that in, since its easy to enter the "antivirus quarantine" but not to leave, one way safe border, where people choose not to [copy outside and execute, obey, or believe] whats inside it which would be their own fault since they were told its an antivirus quaratine so have no reasonable expectation to believe thats safe, but it is safe inside the wikibinator203 VM used thru canvas webAudioAPI textareas checkboxes gamepads etc, since all lambdas only generate more lambdas and dont need execute permission. Both namespaces exist across many computers at once.

The rest of this readme got too long and disorganized, will rewrite soon.
