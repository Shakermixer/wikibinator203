# wikibinator203
If you want the universal lambda that works, go to <a href=https://github.com/benrayfield/wikibinator106>wikibinator106</a>, for now. This different universal lambda function will hopefully be working soon with some simple games and demos people can play together, as actual javascript lambdas that implement the universal lambda math.

Doesnt work yet, see wikibinator106. (TODO custom opensource license) For making massively-multiplayer browser or desktop apps, games, science tools, number crunching, security research, etc, a universal lambda function (combinator), GPU optimizable, javascript eval optimizable, 256 bit ids of merkle forest, each lambda has 2 lambda childs and all paths lead to the universal lambda.

LICENSE: Basically you can do almost anything you want except nobody owns the generated lambdas and nobody is allowed to stop others from sharing lambdas that they have, but if every information must have an owner and author, then the owner and author of every possible lambda is the universal lambda, but details of how to get various legal structures to go along with that for every possible lambda, even when people get into their usual conflicts, needs some more details, so the custom opensource license... See "TODO write my own opensource license" in wikibinator203.js, and in general it will be nearly "all permissive" but also copyleft and makes strange statements about unusual combos of intellectual property of generated lambdas, internet routing, and strange legal issues that have come up in other peer to peer networks.

Here's an incomplete (havent committed to it) license I'm working on writing...

Nobody owns the facts of math. In a recursive copyleft way, nobody owns the generated output, which are all lambdas that are derivative works of the universal lambda, but other than that you can hook it to whatever you want, at your own risk and the risk of any system which wrongly trusted you. All such lambdas are facts of math.

Its necessary, because so many lambdas will be created and shared, much faster than they can all be verified to obey all the rules of the normal world, to just protect the world from these possible behaviors, but define these behaviors (the math of the universal lambda) as normal inside the sandbox...
..
In theory, wikibinator203 is, among other things, an antivirus so advanced it needs no updates to safely contain and share (with other wikibinator203 VMs) viruses, botnets, ransomware, or any kind of information, because it whitelists by turing-complete formal-verification (verifying the calculation of the universal lambda, which includes that if one thing in the sandbox infects another thing in the sandbox with a specific virus, that the calculation of that virus is done exactly as the math of the universal lambda says to, and that it doesnt escape the sandbox, and since all clean lambdas are immutable and stateless, a program can only be fork-edited like to ask "what would happen if that virus infected it" and can have both forks existing at once, so being infected by a virus is voluntary and so is all other combos of the universal lambda such as musical instruments or games or science tools) instead of blacklisting by observation after failure, but wikibinator only protects inside its its sandboxes, which can be private or a peer to peer network of a variety of interoperable wikibinator203 VMs that each compute the same universal lambda (combinator) and may differ in optimizations and security practices etc. If a user chooses to copy things out of such a sandbox aka antivirus quarantine then it is their own fault/negligence if that lets viruses, "dark web", ransomware, or worse, loose on their computer, so if you are not a math expert you probably should not copy any files out of a wikibinator203 sandbox to run by double clicking them, for example, and insteadany people and artificial intelligences in a global sandbox can work and play together safely, viewing and interacting with the sandbox through safe web standards such as html canvas and WebAudioAPI and gamepad api, textareas, checkboxes, etc. Therefore, even if something would normally be blacklisted in other systems, that thing as pure information in a wikibinator203 sandbox is safe, but peoples or programs reactions to those things are outside such a sandbox, so to be safe, dont obey or believe or give execute permission to anything in the sandboxes unless you take responsibility for that it may have been generated maliciously and is in an antivirus quarantine/sandbox while apps and games and tools run entirely inside such sandbox. Some of those tools, many people and artificial intelligences can build together inside sandbox, can help to organize and filter lambdas, using lambdas, such as a "spam filter" or turing-complete searching for "lambdas that return 42 when called on themself". A person has no reasonable expectation that the contents of an antivirus quarantine (wikibinator203 sandbox, whose borders cross many computers and run apps in realtime) is safe or legal aka may be part of the "dark web", so be careful not to "let a tiger out of its cage" (as a tiger roaming free may be illegal, while a tiger in a zoo is legal). I dont want to make a system that motivates people to jailbreak it, so all the "doors" open freely from the outside but not from the inside, and to cross between VMs both sides must agree, with a strong and well-explained warning to prevent accidents.

A hash collision of ids would, in theory, only break things inside sandbox, and anyone who wrongly trusted it to compute the universal lambda in some VM that actually does not, but hopefully the VMs will be so simple and bug-free that wont happen. If you need high security, 512 bit ids (instead of the default of 256, with 192 bits of hash) are recommended. Multiple id types can be generated at runtime since an id maker is a lambda that when called on a lambda returns a lambda that is the bits of its id. Every id maker can generate the id of itself, for example, as its very self referencing.

It is invited to attempt to use the rules of the univeral lambda to prove true equals false or whatever contradiction, and to use such "hacking" to the hacker's benefit, therefore motivating normal nontechnical users and math experts, to prove that is not possible in whatever set of axioms they believe. For example, you may make up random 256 bit "fake ids" and send them to internet addresses which are known to be requesting ids. If one requests, outside sandbox, only real ids, then it is to be interpreted as requesting any ids real or made up, for example. UPDATE: not sure if that can be invited without also inviting DoSAttacks, which are more of an inconvenience with automatic recursive turing-complete load-balancing, but still seems inefficient to request them in a license, but also what problems could occur??? if dont request it, cuz then someone could try to inject "the worlds normal rules" into network messages, trying to enforce that only certain bit patterns are allowed.

Anything stored as bitstrings (instead of a .exe file waiting for someone to accidentally click it) is, in lambda form, a complete binary tree of 0s and 1s, where 0 and 1 are 2 specific lambdas, and the last 1 bit marks the end of the bitstring. It is sandboxed since all bitstrings/integers are part of math.

Different universal lambdas must not, outside sandbox (cuz inside, all possible calculations of finite time and finite memory are allowed), have the same Human readable name, so if for example you fork wikibinator203.js to change its opcodes or add behaviors to its opcodes in a way that does not break any known existing lambdas (such as if a parameter is a digital signature signed by you (which otherwise nobody except you would know how to make) or returns a lambda when it otherwise would have infinite looped), then that would be called something other than wikibinator203. You cant make an open-standard proprietary by sneaking modified behaviors into existing derived lambdas, that only work in your kind of VMs, and if you do then hopefully it will be detected by the many interoperable VMs can turing-complete-challenge-response eachother in many combos, including verifying that a runtime generated emulator of the univeral lambda (clean lambdas only) gives the same id for a certain lambda call, as the univeral lambda does, if they want to. If you want to modify behaviors of existing lambdas, you can derive a lambda to do that. They're universal for all calculations of finite time and finite memory. Nobody may own a trademark of any such universal lambda's name based on their derivative work of this, instead only by the world's possible convergence toward open-standards.

Similarly, no patents are allowed for this software or derivative works of it or any patent that would apply to it by a variant of this universal lambda (optimizations of wikibinator203 VMs, ways of using lambdas, things to use lambdas for, ways of figuring out things about lambdas, ways of computing lambdas on exotic matter computers, etc), since its opensource and patents are the opposite of opensource and are an attack on it that are a battle opensource loses when it happens, except the parts of a system unrelated to lambdas. It should be an open-standard. Money can be made other ways related to it, such as paying people to find solutions to question, where question(answer)->scoreAsFloat64Number, which could be a way to turing-complete search simple things many times per second andOr a way to hire people and artificial intelligences for "contract jobs".
