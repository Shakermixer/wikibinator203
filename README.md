If you want the universal lambda that works, go to <a href=https://github.com/benrayfield/wikibinator106>wikibinator106</a>, for now. This different universal lambda function will hopefully be working soon with some simple games and demos people can play together, as actual javascript lambdas that implement the universal lambda math.

First app running on this will maybe be musical instruments similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data that can be shared in realtime to build more musical instruments with and so on, and this "proof of concept" will be able to scale to millions of simultaneous instruments being played and generated and evolved, and every bit, every tiny part of a sound vibration, is a lambda.

Custom opensource to be written, basically similar to the MIT license except that you cant own the generated lambdas and that the evil_bit bewing on or off in each 256 bit id means 1 of 2 namespaces, one where things work as normal and the other where "anything goes" as its an "antivirus quarantine" and uncensored area.

The rest of this readme got too long and disorganized, will rewrite soon.
