# wikibinator203
If you want the universal lambda that works, go to <a href=https://github.com/benrayfield/wikibinator106>wikibinator106</a>, for now. This different universal lambda function will hopefully be working soon with some simple games and demos people can play together, as actual javascript lambdas that implement the universal lambda math.

First app running on this will maybe be musical instruments similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data that can be shared in realtime to build more musical instruments with and so on, and this "proof of concept" will be able to scale to millions of simultaneous instruments being played and generated and evolved, and every bit, every tiny part of a sound vibration, is a lambda. Float64 roundoff in javascript Math.sin Math.exp etc is allowed in nondeterministic roundoff lambda calls but those parts are not normally shared, just a transform from one clean lambda to another, or less efficiently there will be derived https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754 multiply, plus, etc (and I can match the value of Math.exp to the last digit in javascript, java, and some GPU calculations, experimentally already though needs more testing). In a clean lambda call which uses the tanh op on 64 bits (a complete binary tree of 64 lambdas each 0 or 1, which are each derived from the universal lambda), for example, it must return the float64 closest to the actual value of infinite precision tanh (breaking ties by TODO some standard way of sorting 64 bits, just sort them like a uint64? half-even rounding? or what? take it as a param?... a universal lambda has to be deterministic for the merkle forest of ids to work) even if it has to be computed in pure interpreted mode (if theres no faster way available). In a looser way of calling (which there are 16 kinds of strict vs loose, powerset of 4 kinds) it would just return javascript Math.tanh(param) or GPU.js tanh of float32 (if in an op to allow float32 loss of precision higher on stack), for example. (some strictfp vs loose details to work out) You'll be able to plug an electric guitar into computer's microphone hole(s) (which I have done hundreds of times, though I'm not very good at it) like this https://youtu.be/DJCoOr4uHD4?t=208 (puredata). For those not very good at it, GPU optimized neuralnets andOr code evolution andOr call in experts on a variety of subjects for just a few seconds or as long as you want, might be useful things to try.

Doesnt work yet, see wikibinator106. (TODO custom opensource license) For making massively-multiplayer browser or desktop apps, games, science tools, number crunching, security research, etc, a universal lambda function (combinator), GPU optimizable, javascript eval optimizable, 256 bit ids of merkle forest, each lambda has 2 lambda childs and all paths lead to the universal lambda.

This is something that years ago started as I was looking for how to make an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence algorithm as some kind of binary-forest (tree with 2 childs each and shared branches). It seems a nearer goal to make musical instruments and lambdas in a peer to peer network, and wherever that leads, gradually add smarter code (in the form of calling a universal lambda on itself in various combos, formal-verified, me not above or below anyone else in the peer to peer network, and anyone who might do that could cause the same), leading to AGI hopefully, or think of it as testing the basics of a math system and how people react to it and use it together before doing that kind of thing in more advanced ways. The math works, for sure. This is just a variant of it to scale and tune for practical uses. Its a question of what variety of it to pursue.

Here's an incomplete (havent committed to it) license I'm working on writing (TODO move the ["TODO write my own opensource license" in wikibinator203.js] out of that file and merge any relevant parts into this, get rid of the rest, and keep it as small and simple as possible)...

Copyleft license starts here.

SMALL SUMMARY: Basically you can do almost anything you want except nobody owns the generated lambdas and nobody is allowed to stop others from sharing lambdas that they have, and the space of all possible lambdas includes (some people and laws might view them as) both good and evil lambdas (but to a mathematician all lambdas are neutral) so dont copy them outside the sandbox/antivirusQuarantine unless you take responsibility for if things go wrong, so inside the sandbox/antivirusQuarantine you may be good or neutral (and evil may also happen that you have a neutral opinion about and have no obligation to prevent evil or to prevent evil from benefitting from your "actions", and there are no actions (in clean lambdas) to change state to another state since 100% of the system is cache and therefore can operate consistently across a wormhole to the past or a grandfather-paradox (or more practically for better branch-prediction across big distances, (TODO https://intelligence.org/files/TDT.pdf Timeless Decision Theory ?))), and outside it only good is allowed, but how to do that legally is more complex, and there will literally be viruses (which are lambdas and will not be removed while there exist incoming pointers for merkle garbage collection) etc inside the sandbox/antivirusQuarantine so it is not a legal trick but an actual way of organizing things safely (its far more efficient to prove math than to prove things in a courtroom), including possible superintelligent AI viruses, in theory so seek advice of peer review before trusting the web of interoperable-in-realtime wikibinator203 VMs that in theory will enforce the rules of the universal lambda on eachother by turing-complete-challenge-response...

BIGGER SUMMARY: All lambdas are stateless, immutable, and fork-editable, so all uses and combos of them are voluntary, and nobody has technical ability to change what anyone else builds or uses, except to build lambdas from lambdas to vary their behaviors, add or remove behaviors, or measure eachother, in a repeatable peer reviewable way in the clean lambdas (unlike where nondeterministic roundoff etc is used optionally). Its safe to link from the "normal web" into the antivirusQuarantine/sandbox by a 256 bit or 512 bit id, used similar to a #hashtag, since that does not give it execute permission. no patents related to lambdas. no trademarks of lambdas, especially a universal lambda. no copyrights of lambdas. yes copyrights of interoperable-in-realtime VMs, but VMs that compute different universal lambdas must not use the same human readable name for those universal lambdas. because of the technical inability to verify trillions of lambdas per second each obey all the rules of the "normal world", such as "virus" seems to be defined as any program that humans strongly dislike, stored and evaling lambdas (including bitstrings) are an antivirus quarantine and sandbox that exists across many computers. As usual anyone who copies out of an antivirus quarantine and obeys, believes, or gives execute permission to it (such as by downloading or generating an exe file and double clicking it) is at fault/negligence if something goes wrong from that (you can digital signature and compute to prove things to eachother depending what axioms you believe), unlike how misinformation and viruses are often blacklisted in "the normal internet" vs "dark web" etc. Since lambdas are made of 2 lambdas each recursively, there is no technical ability to remove "bad" lambdas without damaging potentially trillion or more "good" lambdas that have merkle forest paths to them, so if goodness/badness cant be computed at time of calling a lambda on a lambda to find/create lambda then it us technically not possible to run such a system efficient enough to be useful while pieces of it are randomly removed and not allowed to be added back from redundant storage. Any lambda sent outward to other computers may be cached and turing complete load balanced automatically, so dont ask for it back since cache never expires. If you use the lambdas inside sandbox/antivirusQuarantine many nontechnical people can work and play and build together safely, only putting themself and those who wrongly trusted them at risk if they let it out of sandbox. The borders of sandbox will be clearly marked and may be a private sandbox or global sandbox across many computers but not allowing networking to computers not opted in to this universal lambda and running a VM to avoid botnet and DoSAtrack behaviors etc. There will be actual viruses in quarantine, along with games, science tools, musical instruments, etc, and the world will be protected from such viruses escaping sandbox. all in theory of course. but the viruses wont be removed unless there are no imcoming pointers by merkle garbage collection. This is all in theory, and the programmers of the many interoperable-in-realtime VMs take no responsibility for if the VMs dont obey the spec dont compute the universal lambda as they should are buggy etc, by accident, and if you have any legal claims against any content etc the standard response will be to antivirus quarantine it or disprove such claims but keep your "normal rules" off our antivirus quarantine areas if possible, but such things would affect those who copy from quarantine/sandbox to "the normal internet" etc but not including just into peoples minds (which canvas webaudioapi eyes ears etc may be a path of copying to the mind) etc since thought-police are illegal, so seek advice from peer review before trusting.

Nobody owns the facts of math. In a recursive copyleft way, nobody owns the generated output, which are all lambdas that are derivative works of the universal lambda, but other than that you can hook it to whatever you want, at your own risk and the risk of any system which wrongly trusted you. All such lambdas are facts of math.

Its necessary, because so many lambdas will be created and shared, much faster than they can all be verified to obey all the rules of the normal world, to just protect the world from these possible behaviors, but define these behaviors (the math of the universal lambda) as normal inside the sandbox...
..
In theory, wikibinator203 is, among other things, an antivirus so advanced it needs no updates to safely contain and share (with other wikibinator203 VMs) viruses, botnets, ransomware, or any kind of information, because it whitelists by turing-complete formal-verification (verifying the calculation of the universal lambda, which includes that if one thing in the sandbox infects another thing in the sandbox with a specific virus, that the calculation of that virus is done exactly as the math of the universal lambda says to, and that it doesnt escape the sandbox, and since all clean lambdas are immutable and stateless, a program can only be fork-edited like to ask "what would happen if that virus infected it" and can have both forks existing at once, so being infected by a virus is voluntary and so is all other combos of the universal lambda such as musical instruments or games or science tools) instead of blacklisting by observation after failure, but wikibinator only protects inside its its sandboxes, which can be private or a peer to peer network of a variety of interoperable wikibinator203 VMs that each compute the same universal lambda (combinator) and may differ in optimizations and security practices etc. If a user chooses to copy things out of such a sandbox aka antivirus quarantine then it is their own fault/negligence if that lets viruses, "dark web", ransomware, or worse, loose on their computer, so if you are not a math expert you probably should not copy any files out of a wikibinator203 sandbox to run by double clicking them, for example, and insteadany people and artificial intelligences in a global sandbox can work and play together safely, viewing and interacting with the sandbox through safe web standards such as html canvas and WebAudioAPI and gamepad api, textareas, checkboxes, etc. Therefore, even if something would normally be blacklisted in other systems, that thing as pure information in a wikibinator203 sandbox is safe, but peoples or programs reactions to those things are outside such a sandbox, so to be safe, dont obey or believe or give execute permission to anything in the sandboxes unless you take responsibility for that it may have been generated maliciously and is in an antivirus quarantine/sandbox while apps and games and tools run entirely inside such sandbox. Some of those tools, many people and artificial intelligences can build together inside sandbox, can help to organize and filter lambdas, using lambdas, such as a "spam filter" or turing-complete searching for "lambdas that return 42 when called on themself". A person has no reasonable expectation that the contents of an antivirus quarantine (wikibinator203 sandbox, whose borders cross many computers and run apps in realtime) is safe or legal aka may be part of the "dark web", so be careful not to "let a tiger out of its cage" (as a tiger roaming free may be illegal, while a tiger in a zoo is legal). I dont want to make a system that motivates people to jailbreak it, so all the "doors" open freely from the outside but not from the inside, and to cross between VMs both sides must agree, with a strong and well-explained warning to prevent accidents.

A hash collision of ids would, in theory, only break things inside sandbox, and anyone who wrongly trusted it to compute the universal lambda in some VM that actually does not, but hopefully the VMs will be so simple and bug-free that wont happen. If you need high security, 512 bit ids (instead of the default of 256, with 192 bits of hash) are recommended. Multiple id types can be generated at runtime since an id maker is a lambda that when called on a lambda returns a lambda that is the bits of its id. Every id maker can generate the id of itself, for example, as its very self referencing.

It is invited to attempt to use the rules of the univeral lambda to prove true equals false or whatever contradiction, and to use such "hacking" to the hacker's benefit, therefore motivating normal nontechnical users and math experts, to prove that is not possible in whatever set of axioms they believe. For example, you may make up random 256 bit "fake ids" and send them to internet addresses which are known to be requesting ids. If one requests, outside sandbox, only real ids, then it is to be interpreted as requesting any ids real or made up, for example. UPDATE: not sure if that can be invited without also inviting DoSAttacks, which are more of an inconvenience with automatic recursive turing-complete load-balancing, but still seems inefficient to request them in a license, but also what problems could occur??? if dont request it, cuz then someone could try to inject "the worlds normal rules" into network messages, trying to enforce that only certain bit patterns are allowed.

Anything stored as bitstrings (instead of a .exe file waiting for someone to accidentally click it) is, in lambda form, a complete binary tree of 0s and 1s, where 0 and 1 are 2 specific lambdas, and the last 1 bit marks the end of the bitstring. It is sandboxed since all bitstrings/integers are part of math.

Different universal lambdas must not, outside sandbox (cuz inside, all possible calculations of finite time and finite memory are allowed), have the same Human readable name, so if for example you fork wikibinator203.js to change its opcodes or add behaviors to its opcodes in a way that does not break any known existing lambdas (such as if a parameter is a digital signature signed by you (which otherwise nobody except you would know how to make) or returns a lambda when it otherwise would have infinite looped), then that would be called something other than wikibinator203. You cant make an open-standard proprietary by sneaking modified behaviors into existing derived lambdas, that only work in your kind of VMs, and if you do then hopefully it will be detected by the many interoperable VMs can turing-complete-challenge-response eachother in many combos, including verifying that a runtime generated emulator of the univeral lambda (clean lambdas only) gives the same id for a certain lambda call, as the univeral lambda does, if they want to. If you want to modify behaviors of existing lambdas, you can derive a lambda to do that. They're universal for all calculations of finite time and finite memory. Nobody may own a trademark of any such universal lambda's name based on their derivative work of this, instead only by the world's possible convergence toward open-standards.

Similarly, no patents are allowed for this software or derivative works of it or any patent that would apply to it by a variant of this universal lambda (optimizations of wikibinator203 VMs, ways of using lambdas, things to use lambdas for, ways of figuring out things about lambdas, ways of computing lambdas on exotic matter computers, etc), since its opensource and patents are the opposite of opensource and are an attack on it that are a battle opensource loses when it happens (and if you have a patent you are likely to be threatened with other patents until you transfer ownership of it to patent pools which threaten eachother similar to WMDs threaten eachother in Mutually Assured Destruction), except the parts of a system unrelated to lambdas. It should be an open-standard. Money can be made other ways related to it, such as paying people to find solutions to question, where question(answer)->scoreAsFloat64Number, which could be a way to turing-complete search simple things many times per second andOr a way to hire people and artificial intelligences for "contract jobs".
