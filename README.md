If you want the universal lambda that works, go to <a href=https://github.com/benrayfield/wikibinator106>wikibinator106</a>, for now. This different universal lambda function will hopefully be working soon with some simple games and demos people can play together, as actual javascript lambdas that implement the universal lambda math.

Doesnt work yet, see wikibinator106. (TODO custom opensource license) For making massively-multiplayer browser or desktop apps, games, science tools, number crunching, security research, etc, a universal lambda function (combinator), GPU optimizable, javascript eval optimizable, 256 bit ids of merkle forest, each lambda has 2 lambda childs and all paths lead to the universal lambda.

LICENSE: Basically you can do almost anything you want except nobody owns the generated lambdas and nobody is allowed to stop others from sharing lambdas that they have, but if every information must have an owner and author, then the owner and author of every possible lambda is the universal lambda, but details of how to get various legal structures to go along with that for every possible lambda, even when people get into their usual conflicts, needs some more details, so the custom opensource license... See "TODO write my own opensource license" in wikibinator203.js, and in general it will be nearly "all permissive" but also copyleft and makes strange statements about unusual combos of intellectual property of generated lambdas, internet routing, and strange legal issues that have come up in other peer to peer networks.
